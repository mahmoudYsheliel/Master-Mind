- Solves the code using a logical deduction algorithm
- Built with Vue.js frontend and JavaScript-based AI logic
- Allow dynamic number of cells and attempts limits

## ðŸ§  How the Game Works

The player (or AI) guesses a 4-digit number. After each guess:
- **Right Number**: Number exists in the code but may be misplaced.
- **Right Position**: Number is both correct and correctly positioned.

The AI uses this feedback to iteratively narrow down possible combinations.

## AI Strategy

The AI applies a constraint satisfaction approach:
- Filters out inconsistent combinations based on prior feedback
- Stops once it finds a guess with all digits correct and in the right positions
